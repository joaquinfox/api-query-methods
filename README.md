# API Queries with React

### Intro and purpose

This repository demonstrates different methods of getting data from an API, using React. It is _not_ a deep dive into the pros and cons of each method. It _is_ a working template of alternative techniques.

For a discussion on the pros and cons of each method see [How To Fetch Data In React](https://reedbarger.com/fetch-data-in-react/), by [Reed Barger](https://reedbarger.com/).

Query methods covered:

- fetch
- axios
- useFetch
- React Query.

I will also iterate on each method and show alternate syntax for structuring a query. The goal is to provide a comprehensive gallery of alternative tools and syntax for calling API's.

### API endpoints used

- [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
- [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me/)
- [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs.json)

The first two are fake data generators. They are great for testing and learning but they are simplistic. Reddit is used to make things a little harder and more realistic.
